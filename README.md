# My second Project at GA code school - Full Stack Project

-   This is `Favorite Books` application that keeps tracks of childrens favorite books for an authenticated user
-   Its a responsive single page application primarly built using JavaScript and Ruby on Rails
-   This is my second project in javascript and first using ruby on rails

In the future plan is to include support for the following:

-   Track childrens favorite videos
-   List the books and videos for selection, that are available from the backend database

I am open to feedback and suggestions. If you have any please connect and share

## Technologies and Tools Used

1.  HTML, CSS, Javascript, AJAX, Bootstrap, CURL scripts
2.  GIT for code repository and version control
3.  ATOM javascript editor
4.  Ruby on Rails is used to build the backend APIs
    -   Here is the link to the [`Backend Repo`](https://github.com/MayoorPatil/map-rails-api)
    -   Here is the link to the [`Backend Endpoint`](https://map-rails-api.herokuapp.com/)

## Development Process

Here is how I approached the development of this application

1.  Had the requirements broken down into user stories and also had a basic wireframe created
2.  Based on that I did some pseudo code and spent some time designing the flow of the application
3.  Then I built basic html file so that I could start coding the backend APIs. I targted this challenging part first since I was comfortable with other aspects of the project such as integrating the ajax service calls and displaying the response received from the API back to the users
4.  With every little change I made i unit tested all along to minimize defects and fixes. This helped a lot as I was able to identify minor defects and fix along the way.
5.  All along I also ensured every feature was committed and pushed to the GIT repository. This was specifically helpful since I knew exactly what had changed with each feature and did not have to struggle and go through a ton of code to fix or implement any missing functionality
